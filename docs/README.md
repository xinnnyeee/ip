# Ekko - Your Personal Task Manager

Ekko is a simple, interactive task manager built with JavaFX. It helps users keep track of tasks, deadlines, and notes efficiently.

Notice all commands are capitalised? Don't worry, all commands are made case-insensitive, so you can type in anyhow you want! 

## Features

### 📝 Task Management
- **TODO**: Add a general task.
  ```
  TODO <description>
  ```
- **DEADLINE**: Add a task with a due date and time.
  ```
  DEADLINE <description> /by DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM
  ```
- **EVENT**: Add an event with a start and end time.
  ```
  EVENT <description> /from DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM /to DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM
  ```

### ✅ Task Updates

  ```

### 🔍 Searching & Listing

  ```

### 📝 Notes
